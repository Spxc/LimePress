-----
LimePress was started due that i've been making alot of websites, all using an different way of handeling sql connections and dynamic content.
So i decided to make a CMS which is lightweight. It's really easy to use, you only need to know how to make a basic website using CSS 3 and HTML 4/5
If you ever tried to make a theme for Drupal and Wordpress you know it's a pain in the butt to start with. The goal of this project is simply to make an easy to use, easy to theme and easy to work with CMS (Content Managment System).

Getting started
---------------
1. Fork this project
2. Uplad to your server/localhost
3. Make sure you have MySql and PHP 5.4 installed
4. Setup the site by simply visiting it
